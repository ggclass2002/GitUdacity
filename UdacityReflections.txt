Some thought about learning GIT.

Keeping track of basic git commands:

cd folder_name (change directory to folder_name)

ls (lists visible files in directory)
ls -a (lists all files, including hidden ones)

git --version (to check latest version)

git clone <url> (to clone a repository)

git config --global color.ui auto (to allow for insertion/deletion formatting)

git log (check commits) 
	use 'q' to quit its output

git diff <id_1> <id_2> (compare commits)
	use 'q' to quit its output

git init (creates a git repository in current folder)

git status (checks which files have changed since last commit)

git checkout <id> (opens that commit)
	HEAD is the latest commit
	Detached HEAD warns about working with previous commit

Configuirng user name and email address:
	Run git config --global user.name "Your name"
    	Run git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"

Configuring text editor:
	git config --global core.editor "program_name -n -w"
or	git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"

working directory
	staging area (intermediate step before commiting)
		repository

git add <file> (adds file to staging area)

git reset <file> (removes file from staging area)

git commit 
	text editor opens: include note of change made at the top.
	save the note and close window to be able to continue.
